# Diabetes mellitus prediction
A MiniProject

Diabetes is the fast-growing disease among the people even among the youngsters. In understanding diabetes 
and how it develops, we need to understand what happens in the body without diabetes. Sugar (glucose) 
comes from the foods that we eat, specifically carbohydrate foods. Carbohydrate foods provide our body with 
its main energy source everybody, even those people with diabetes, needs carbohydrate. Carbohydrate foods 
include bread, cereal, pasta, rice, fruit, dairy products and vegetables (especially starchy vegetables). When 
we eat these foods, the body breaks them down into glucose. The glucose moves around the body in the 
bloodstream. Some of the glucose is taken to our brain to help us think clearly and function. The remainder of 
the glucose is taken to the cells of our body for energy and also to our liver, where it is stored as energy that 
is used later by the body. In order for the body to use glucose for energy, insulin is required. Insulin is a 
hormone that is produced by the beta cells in the pancreas. Insulin works like a key to a door. Insulin attaches 
itself to doors on the cell, opening the door to allow glucose to move from the blood stream, through the door, 
and into the cell. If the pancreas is not able to produce enough insulin (insulin deficiency) or if the body cannot 
use the insulin it produces (insulin resistance), glucose builds up in the bloodstream (hyperglycaemia) and 
diabetes develops. Diabetes Mellitus means high levels of sugar (glucose) in the blood stream and in the urine.
